Instead of this, you receive a punishment - the game randomly selects a tag from a list of kinky tags and shows your random X pictures from rule34.xxx website using this tag. You are required to choose one of the pictures - it could be either what you like more, what picture you have to enjoy, what your partner has to do with you, what you have to send your friend, or any other punishment you can imagine ^^.
